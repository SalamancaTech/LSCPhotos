LSC Photobooth // v2.5LSC Photobooth is a client-side multimodal synthesis engine designed for high-fidelity character consistency and sequential art generation. It leverages the gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview model (Nano Banana) to generate complex compositions, photo strips, and comic pages.Unlike standard text-to-image interfaces, this application utilizes a Composite Assembly Pipeline: rather than generating a multi-panel image in a single inference pass (which often leads to mode collapse or repetition), the engine deconstructs the request into parallel tasks, generates unique panels with enforced variance, and programmatically stitches them into the final layout.🏗 System ArchitectureThe Composite PipelineDeconstruction: The user's request (e.g., "4-Panel Comic") is broken down into discrete task objects.Pose Injection: The system injects unique pose/expression constraints into each task's prompt to prevent "static character" syndrome.Parallel Inference: The engine executes concurrent API calls to Gemini 2.5 Flash. This ensures each panel receives the model's full attention regarding character identity.Canvas Stitching: The client-side logic receives the raw Base64 buffers and composites them onto a mathematically generated canvas (Strip, Grid, or Single Page) before rendering the final output.Core ModulesIdentity Binding Protocol: Users can tag reference images (e.g., "Character A"). The system prompt explicitly maps specific visual inputs to semantic actors in the scene description to minimize hallucinations.Correction Pen (Inpainting): A canvas-based editing layer allowing users to draw on generated results and provide natural language instructions for targeted regeneration.Session Lightbox: A volatile memory gallery that persists generated artifacts for the duration of the session.🚀 Modes of Operation1. Composition DirectorTarget: Single, high-fidelity photorealistic scenes.Logic: Focuses on blending multiple input characters into a coherent environment with unified lighting.2. Photo BoothTarget: Stylized, sequential photography.Formats: * Vertical Strip (4): Classic mall photobooth style.Grid (2x2): Square collage.Wide/Retro: Single stylized prints.Behavior: Enforces distinct poses per frame to mimic the passage of time.3. Comic EditorTarget: Narrative sequential art.Logic: Accepts a multi-line script. Line 1 maps to Panel 1, Line 2 to Panel 2, etc.Styles: Manga, Noir, Western Hero, Silver Age, etc.🛠 Installation & UsageThis is a Zero-Build artifact. It requires no Node.js runtime, build steps, or backend server. It runs entirely in the browser.Clone/Download:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/lsc-photobooth.git](https://github.com/your-username/lsc-photobooth.git)
